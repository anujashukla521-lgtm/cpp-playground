This folder contains C++ programs that demonstrate the concept of polymorphism using object-oriented programming.

## Concepts Covered
- Virtual functions
- Runtime polymorphism
- Base class and derived class
- Function overriding
- Pointer to base class
- Virtual destructor
- Dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete`

## Purpose
These programs are written to understand runtime behavior of objects in C++ and to practice polymorphism concepts commonly asked in exams and technical interviews.

This repository is my C++ playground, where I experiment, practice, and explore core C++ concepts through small programs and examples.It’s a space for learning by doing — testing ideas, understanding logic,
and improving problem-solving skills.

🚀 What You’ll Find Here

🧩 C++ basics and core concepts
🧩 Practice programs and experiments
🧩 Concept-focused examples
🧩 Code written for clarity and learning

🧠 Concepts Practiced

* Variables & Data Types
* Conditional Statements
* Loops
* Functions
* Arrays & Strings
* Pointers & References
* Structures & Basics of OOP
* STL experiments (as I learn)
(This list grows as I explore more.)

🛠 Language & Tools

* Language: C++
* IDE: VS Code
* Compiler: GCC

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Practice and strengthen C++ fundamentals.
* Experiment with new concepts freely.
* Build confidence in writing C++ code.
* Maintain a learning playground alongside DSA.
  
📌 Note

This is a learning-focused repository. Some programs are exploratory and may not be optimized — improvement is part of the journey.

⭐ Explore & Learn

Feel free to explore the code and learn along with me as I continue my C++ journey.

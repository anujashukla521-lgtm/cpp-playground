# C++ Playground  

Welcome to my C++ Practice Repository!
This is where I upload all the C++ programs I write while learning and improving my programming & problem-solving skills.  


## What's Inside?

✔ Basic C++ Programs  
✔ Practice Questions  
✔ Logic-building Exercises  

Each file is simple, clear, and written for learning purposes.


##  Languages & Tools

🔹 C++  
🔹 VS Code / CodeBlocks / Dev C++

## Why I Created This Repo?

I am currently a *BCA student*, and this repo helps me:

✨ Stay consistent  
✨ Track my progress  
✨ Build logic & confidence  
✨ Share my journey publicly  

If you're learning C++ too, feel free to check the codes 😊  

## 🚀 How to Run These Programs

1️⃣ Install a C++ compiler (like `g++`)  
2️⃣ Open terminal / command prompt  
3️⃣ Run the program using:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp
./a.exe   (Windows)
./a.out   (Mac / Linux)

💡 My Learning Goals

✔ Write clean & understandable code
✔ Practice daily
✔ Get strong in problem-solving
✔ Prepare for placements & interviews
